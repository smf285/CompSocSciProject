## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

* For my app, I found data about knowledge of different languages in New Jersey and the United States. The data has numbers of speakers by age group - minor (under 18), adults (18-64 years of age), and seniors (65+) - and by language family.

Simple bar charts that are modified by the user's input give a rough idea of the distribution of language knowledge.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

ACS_data <- read_csv("data/real_app_data_csv.csv")
ACS_data2 <- read_csv("data/2nd-app-dataset_csv.csv")

ggplot(data = ACS_data, mapping = aes(x = Age, y = Speakers, fill = Language)) + geom_col(position = "dodge") + theme_classic() + labs(title = "Number of Language Speakers in NJ by Age", x = "Age", y = "Number of Speakers")
# With this particular plot, the data about age will be filtered based on the user's input.

ggplot(data = ACS_data2, mapping = aes(x = Level, y = Speakers, fill = Language)) + geom_col(position = "dodge") + theme_classic() + labs(title = "Number of Language Speakers by Level", x = "Level", y = "Number of Speakers")

# In the app, this particular plot will involve data about the level (national vs state) based on the user's input.
